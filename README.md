# Infant_Mortality_Project
R project to generate a visualization of infant mortality data by country utilizing data from the United Nations. 
This code will generate both a one dimensional map as well as a KML file for import into Google Earth to create a 3 dimensional model. These graphics use different sized circles to represent the size of the population and color these circles based on infant mortality per 1000 live births.
